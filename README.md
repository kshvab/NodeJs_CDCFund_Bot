# NodeJs CDCFund Bot

> The bot is available at the link: [@CDCtestBot](http://telegram.me/CDCtestBot)

## What can this bot do?

### Displays:

* capitalization of the fund
* emission of internal tokens
* the price of the tokens
* change the price of tokens for 24 hours
* the price of the assets of the fund and their change

### After a user request, the bot checks its participation in the fund and displays personal information (the user's balance).

#### Here are some interface images:

### I also put a HTML file in the folder that takes data from the fund management system and shows it to the clients:
